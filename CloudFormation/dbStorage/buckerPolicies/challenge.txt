Get familiar with Bucket policies:



- In the S3 web console, create a bucket and enable static web hosting.

- Create an index.html (or use any sample file) and upload it to your bucket.

- Using the AWS CLI Tool and your text editor, create a bucket policy 
to enable public access to it (Hint: Use the AWS Documentation ).

- Update the policy to restrict access only to your own IP address.
